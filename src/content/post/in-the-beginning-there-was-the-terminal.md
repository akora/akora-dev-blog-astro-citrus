In this age of the attention economy it's crucial to decide where to put focus on, the only limited resouce you have is time.

Once decided that I'm going to deep dive into software development (again), and will spend most of my time in front of the terminal, I needed a terminal that looks great and would make me happy.

Based on [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), I created a collection of themes that I call [The Emptiness Machine Theme Collection](https://github.com/akora/oh-my-posh-themes).

## The Emptiness Machine Theme Collection

Linkin Park just released their new album "[From Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Zero)", and the song "The Emptiness Machine" resonated so much.

Before starting the actual work, I just hopped on Discord, reached out to Midjourney and generated the following piece of art:

A few iterations later I settled on:

This was the colour pallette I wanted to explore further. Which led me to make some iterations on the colours.

### The Dark Theme

Classic "grayscale" look, with a tiny bit of blue.

### The Blue Theme

VERY blue, maybe too much of blue, but goes well with any blue heavy OS theme.

### The Blue Gradient Theme

Tried to keep the textual values still readable while using a gradient for the background.

### The Blue Skies Theme

My personal favorite, a mix of blue and white, my daily driver.

### The Gray Blue Theme

More on the darker side, works well in mostly monochrome OS themes.

### The Time Theme

The significant difference here is the time displayed in the prompt.

In the [Github repo](https://github.com/akora/oh-my-posh-themes) you can find all the corresponding files that you can use in your shell config.
