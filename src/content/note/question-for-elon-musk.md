I have a question for Elon Musk.

Explaining the context does not fit into a tweet. So I created this. It's an honest question, I'm curious. If you can help getting this question to him, I'd appreciate your help!

The question is about space travel, specifically the concept of a "generation ship." The thought experiment is as follows: imagine we want to reach a distant, habitable planet. It's so far away—and we can only travel much slower than the speed of light—that it takes longer than the average human lifespan to get there. This means that on the ship, there will be people who were born on Earth but will die on the ship, never seeing the destination planet. There will also be people who are born on the ship and will reach the new planet.

However, there will be people who are born on the ship, who have never experienced living on Earth and will never experience living on the new planet.

The question is: would you want to be one of those people?
