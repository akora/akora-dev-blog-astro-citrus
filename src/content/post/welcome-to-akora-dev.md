# Welcome to akora.dev

After months of planning and procrastination, I've finally launched my developer blog! This space will serve as my digital garden where I'll share insights, tutorials, and reflections on my journey as a developer.

1. Reinforce my own learning
2. Help other developers facing similar challenges
3. Build a community around shared knowledge
4. Document my growth as a developer

This blog is built with:
