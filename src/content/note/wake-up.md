## The chaos of singularity

As a somewhat uncommon take on what the term _singularity_ means I define it as

- a state where so many things are happening at the same time - or so many things require attention of an individual - that it is no longer possible for that person to keep track of everything and thus crucial information, facts are lost and actions are not taken.

I believe we are reaching that stage these days. It's not imminent and this is due to one fact: we humans have a coping mechanism where we filter out anything that's not required to survive.

This can be the main reason why the "exponential growth fallacy" holds true.
