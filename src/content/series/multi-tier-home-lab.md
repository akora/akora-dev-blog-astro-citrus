## Building a Multi-Tier Home Lab

This series will walk you through the process of designing and building a multi-tier home lab.

We'll cover everything from naming conventions and service design to the very first step of creating an SSH key pair, all the way to the final step of seeing all the services on one dashboard.

To follow along, please regularly check the [akora/homelab](https://github.com/akora/homelab) repository on GitHub for the latest updates.

Assumptions:

- you have some hardware lying around that you can repurpose for this project (e.g. old PCs, old laptops, Raspberry Pis)
- you have a machine that can be used for managing the code base and accessing all the remote servers and their services
- you have Ansible installed on your local machine
- you have Git installed on your local machine
- you have a router that has DHCP enabled
- you have a domain name that you can use for your home lab

...and pretty much, that's it.
